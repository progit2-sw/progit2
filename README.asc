= Pro Git, Toleo la Pili

Karibu kwenye kitabu cha Pro Git book toleo la pilei

Unaweza kupata kitabu hiki kwenye mtandao hapa: http://git-scm.com/book

Kama toleo la kwanza, toleo la pili ni open source kwa licensi ya Creative Commons license.

Kuna mambo mengi yamebadilika tangu toleo la kwanza la open source.
Kitu kimoja wapo ni kwamba kwenye kuwasilisha maneno tumetomia Asciidoc format badala ya Markdown 

We've also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository.
See link:TRANSLATING.md[the translating document] for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

You can generate the e-book files manually with Asciidoctor.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at progit.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at progit.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at progit.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF output at progit.pdf
----
